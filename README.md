## lgw (Legalize Gay Weed)
Stupid clone of the rainbow link on http://tehurn.com/index to get my feet
wet with Go.

### Installation
you should be able to `go get github.com/ubercow/lgw`

### Requirements
You need SGR which you can get at http://github.com/foize/go.sgr

### Known bugs
It leaks memory all over the place. But if you are running this long enough
for it to leak memory, you probably should rethink your life.
